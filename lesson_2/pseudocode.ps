 function that returns the sum of two numbers


Given two numbers
 -save the first number as variable 1
 -save the second variable as variable 2
 -create function with two inputs
 -function returns the sum of the two inputs
 -two inputs are variable 1 and variable 
 

a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Given array of strings
-save new string as empty string

Iterate through of array of strings one by one
-combine the empty string with each elment of the array
-complete until reach end of string

After iterating through array of strings, return the saved value

A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:

everyOther([1,4,7,2,5]); // => [1,7,5]

Given array of integers
-crate blank array
-create for loop with starting value of 0
-push first value to from array of integers to blank array
-increment by 2, for only odd numbers

After iterating through array of integers, return the new array

Start 

set iterator = 0
set array = blank array

While iterator < length of array of integers
  Set array = value within array of integers at space 'iterator'
  iterator = iterator + 2

Print array

End 

a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. 
For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). 
If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return null.

Given string of characters
 
create function with two inputs string of characters & character you would like to find 3 times
save variable named count equal to 0
convert string of characters to array with each character an element
Iterate through array of characters
  -If count is equal to three
    -stop iteration, and return postion of chracater in array 
  -if current character in array is equal to character you would like to find
    -increase count by 1
  -continue iteration until count is equal to three or reach end of string

After iterating array of characters return null

Start

# Given string of characters & character you would like to see if it appears 3 times#

SET iterator = 0
SET count = 0
SET array = string of characters (each element is character of array)

WHILE iterator < array.length
 If count === 3
  PRINT position of current element'
  END
 ELSE If currentElement = character you woud like to see if it appears 3 times
  count++
 iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT null

END

a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. 
The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, 
while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:

merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]); // => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]

Given two arrays of equal length

Iterate through the arrays one by one
 -if iterator is 0 or even push value of first array to new array
 -if iterator is odd, push value of second array to new array

After iterating through the arrays, return the saved value

Start

# Given two arrays of equal length #

SET array = blank array
SET iterator = 0
SET iteratorArray1 = 0
SET iteratorArray2 = 0

WHILE  iterrator < array1.length
 IF remainder of iterator = 0
  array[iterator] = array1[iteratorArray1]
  iteratorArray1 = iteratorArray1 + 1
 ELSE IF remainder of iterator != 0
  array[iterator] = array2[iteratorArray2]
  iteratorArray2 = iteratorArray2 + 1
 iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT array

END
